# Video Store Project

 ## Overview
 R. Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Now facing stiff competition from streaming services, the R. Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

 Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
